# Contributing Documentation to WorldWide Telescope

We would love for you to contribute to the WorldWide Telescope’s documentation!

# How to Contribute

Just submit a pull request, or file an issue if you’d like to discuss an idea
before starting work!

## Framework

Our documentation is written in
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (with the file extension
`.md`) and rendered with [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/). This means each
repository has a `SUMMARY.md` table of contents file in addition to a
`README.md` file that serves as an introduction to the documentation.

## Contributing Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under a
[CC0 1.0 Universal license](LICENSE). Everyone involved in WorldWide Telescope
agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Acknowledgement

This document is derived from documents from the AngularJS and Software
Carpentry projects.
