  <Description>Newcomers to WorldWide Telescope are recommended to browse the growing number of Guided Tours of the sky by astronomers and educators from some of the most respected observatories and planetariums. Most of the features can be discovered by using the program. This documentation is provided as a resource to help describe what is going on, and to help locate the features that this project has to offer. There are two versions of WorldWide Telescope, a Windows application and a web client. This documentation set describes both, where necessary indicating where a feature only applies to one.</Description>

  <Description>This document holds many advanced tutorials and guides for users already familiar with WWT. It is organized loosely by either the intended target audience or common method, for example, "For Explorers" refer to any casual user of WWT, and "Adding Data" refers to how to add different data to WWT to all audiences.</Description>

  <Description>This document describes the data file formats used by the WorldWide Telescope. The files are XML files, and have the extension .WTML. Also covered are a few URL based controls that enable the sharing of single images without creating data files.

Data files are used to add to the default data and user experience of WorldWide Telescope. Data files are used to add single or multiple images -- either foreground images (typically single images referred to as studies) or background images (typically created from a large number of images, covering all or most of the sky, and referred to as surveys), to add tours (animated slide-shows), to create sign up files for communities (public or private groups that can share data), and to add simple or complex sets of data and links for those communities.</Description>

  <Description>WorldWide Telescope can visualize many layers and types of data. The International Space Station is the only built in spacecraft orbit within WWT. This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a layer that displays the Cassini orbital trajectories relative to Saturn by importing the appropriate data within NASA SPICE kernels - the NASA data storage standard. This tutorial builds on topics discussed in the tutorial written describing the process to Create a Traverse Trail Layer and is intended as a subsequent tutorial.</Description>

  <Description>This tutorial will show how to take a subset of current scientific discoveries and quickly make a short (1-2 minute) WorldWide Telescope (WWT) tour and full-dome video.
This tutorial has been created for two reasons. First, we want to demonstrate how to use WWT to create short tours easily. We also want to gauge interest among some institutions to share in the creation of these Science Shorts for the sake of the community.</Description>

    <Description>This document describes a process that can be used to create tiled image pyramids to be used with WorldWide Telescope. A sample implementation of the interfaces and methods is included, and if your source data matches this closely then the sample code provided should work in full or in part for the task. If there are significant differences between the source data used in the samples and the source data you have, then this document should be used to describe a template for implementing the appropriate interfaces and methods.</Description>
